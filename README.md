### Intro
This is a Program that utilises Spout2 to stream a viewport to OBS or any other reciver. It utilises this wrapper https://github.com/you-win/spout-gd and of course Spout 2 https://github.com/leadedge/Spout2. The C# Bindings were generated with "CSharp-Wrapper-Generator-for-GDExtension" at https://github.com/Delsin-Yu/CSharp-Wrapper-Generator-for-GDExtension.
